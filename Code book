The dataset includes the following files:
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

# Subset
The final data, named "data.csv" is a tidy version of all these data sets where 
- train and test variables were merged
- subject, activity and type were added
- activity were labelled
